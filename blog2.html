        <h1>The Main Character is Loosing and the fee Monster is stronger than ever</h1>
        <blockquote>
           ‚ÄúBut what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure?<br>
            of Himself.
            Well, so I will talk about myself <br>

            In a country where there is poverty. <br>
             Why is financial crisis a stigma ?,
             Why is financial crisis looked at as a disease?,
             Why are people so indifferent?

            It was 5 years ago, When the fee Monster first Appeared in the happy wonderland
            the creature terrorized our Main character. 
            the creature would belittle him with the same question again and again
            "why you haven't payed your fees, yet?"
            the terror reflected on our Main Characters' studies, spirit, clothing and also standard of living.
            being asked to stay back in class or finding his name engraved on fee monsters' <span id="creepster">fee defaulters list</span> was a familliar occurence,
            One never gets used to the humiliation and inferiority complexes and the misery and the uncertainity that you carry with it.
            the fellow villagers could not  understand what he was going through and he was 
            not good at expressing himself.

        </p>

            It was always the same problem, it was always this same chapter different characters,it was always the same monster.
            it was like this one chapter was put on a loop by the dreaded fee monster.
            The Main character could fully comprehend
            why IIT or Top tier colleges were a big deal ?
            Why people were driving themselves insane for a good JEE Score ?
            not that he could go back in time and even if he did (with a time machine) ,
            his past self would take him seriously.
            he skipped classes just to avoid the teachers(Fee monsters' righthand men) bugging him to get his fees cleared.
            Slowly developing a deep hatred for Educational institutions and this godforsaken Education/degree on Begged and borrowed money.

            One sad hopeless evening , the main character thought to himself
           <blockquote>
            "I always liked to think I was special. 
             I was destined to fight the fee monster and bring normalcy to
             the village. 
             I wrote ‚Äúgreat‚Äù at the end of my name, (I picked it up from Muhammad ali)      
             I addressed myself as Nuha Khan(the great),
             so much that my fellow villagers reminded it to me when I was trying to get rid of it.
             ‚ÄúThe great‚Äù felt like a curse.
             It‚Äôs ingrained in us to think we‚Äôre the Main Character, 
             Eventhough, we may not have the potential, the grades,
             the talent, the persistence to back this thought.
             Wanting to be valued , to be treated as an individual, to be treated as important.
            I found myself copying Assignments , cheating in Exams and sleeping in classes.
            And slowly felt like just another speck on face of this earth
            The feeling of getting your spirit beaten down,
            The feeling of slowly accepting you are nothing special,
            The feeling that you are a burden on this planet and on this village,
            And I cannot blame anyone but myself.
            </blockquote>

           As our main character  was drowning in his sad philosophies.
           A fairy GodTeacher üë¥ appeared singing "Shaktimaan Shaktimaan"
           with an angelic smile on his face and said
           <blockquote>
               "It's okk to feel overwhelmed but it's not okk to give up"
           </blockquote>
           "But who are you? are you some other monster?"
           The kind teacher replied "I am Tanay Pratap, I will teach you ,I will be your mentor and i "
           Gave him the <bold>Neog Manuscript</bold> and said
           "I will See you in Level 1" and left humming 
           "<em>adbhut shakti hai , Duniya Badal sakti hai , something bhi kar sakti hai, shaktimaan shaktimaan......</em>"

            He is not able to attend college classes but unlike previous chapters, he has not fallen into melancholy, Our hero is not sitting there waiting for help he has started following the guidance of  Master Tanay,I am trying to work for it.
            I am busy completing level0 and also looking forward to land a job through roc8 careers.
            Let's hope the Main Character takes the guidance of the fairy GodTeacher 
            maybe, in this chapter we‚Äôll see some character development, maybe the dreaded fee monster won't be able to totally incapacitate me.
            maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel.
            
            It is not the end of the world

            Tanvi tweeted this-‚Äú Need people who realize that every student has a unique story and challenges. Students are not just numbers on spreadsheets for us ‚Äù
            I have seen my value brought down to the fees I did not pay or my roll no or the percentage i got or the assignment I did not submit.

            A very big thank you to tanay sir.
            For giving the hero of my story a hope.
