            It was 5 years ago, When the fee Monster first Appeared in this Story
            and since then we have witnessed our only hopes' downfall.
            the creature terrorized our Main character in every new chapter. 
            the creature deafened him with the same question of "why you haven't payed your fees, yet?" again and again and again.....<br>
            the Psychological terror reflected in his studies, spirit, clothing and also standard of living.
            Each term he was asked to stay back in class or found his name engraved on fee monsters' <span id="creepster">fee defaulters stone</span> <br>,
            "You never get used to the humiliation and the inferiority complex you go 
            through from being singled out like that", he'd often think to himself.
            the fellow villagers could not understand why he stopped attending the sermons
            and he never had the courage to tell them about his backstory.

        </p>

            It was always the same problem, it was always this same conflict
            ,it was always that same merciless monster.
            it was like this one chapter was put on a loop in this book.
            He finally Understood , 
            Why IIT or Top tier colleges were a big deal ?,<br>
            Why people were driving themselves insane for a good JEE Score ?,<br>
            Why he was an idiot?<br> 
            he could not go back in time, change the lines and even if he did ,his past self would not take him seriously.
            he skipped classes just to avoid the teachers(Fee monsters' righthand men) bugging him to get his fees cleared.
            Slowly developing a deep hatred for Educational institutions and this godforsaken Education/degree on Begged and borrowed money.

        </p>
        <p >
            One sad hopeless evening,
            Tired and exhausted ,he sat beneath a large banyan tree,
            walking where his thoughts lead him and was drowning in his sad philosophies.
           <blockquote>
            "I always liked to think I was special. 
             I was destined to be the hero to this village. 
             I wrote ‚Äúgreat‚Äù at the end of my name,     
             I addressed myself as "Main-character-name"+"the great",
             when realisation hit and I was desparately trying to get rid of "the great",
             fellow villagers reminded it to me.
             ‚ÄúThe great‚Äù felt like a taunt a curse.
             How can I be great?, how can I save this village? when I have made peace
             with my inner doubts and demons.

            It‚Äôs ingrained in us to think we‚Äôre the Main Character, 
            that the world revolved around us.
            Eventhough, we may not have the potential, the grades,
            the talent, the persistence,the story to back this thought.
            but we still want to believe it , to be treated as an individual, to be treated as important.
            eventually, we find ourselves copying Assignments , cheating in Exams and sleeping in classes.
            And cannot help but feel like just another insignificant speck on face of this earth.
            And I cannot blame anyone but myself."

            he heard a melody from some 20rem. 
            "must be someone happier than me",he thought.
            Then out of nowhere this man appeared and with a kind smile said,
           <blockquote>
               "It's okk to feel overwhelmed but it's not okk to give up"
           </blockquote>

            "How did you? Are you reading my mind? Who are you?"<br>
            "I am Tanay Pratap, I can teach you Web-Kung-Fu and make you a webDev "<br>
            and carefully handed him the <bold>Neog lvl0 Manuscript</bold> <br>
            "I will See you in Level 1" and left humming 
           "<em>adbhut shakti hai , Duniya Badal sakti hai , something bhi kar sakti hai,    shaktimaan shaktimaan......</em>"

            Nothing eventful happened in our Main Characters' life so far ,
            and he is not attending college classes but something interesting is happening here,he has not fallen into melancholy, he is not trying to escape reality. unlike previous chapters he has not accepted his fate and equipped with his laptop he is trying to work.
            He is busy completing level0 and also looking forward to land a job through roc8 careers.
            Let's hope the Main Character takes the guidance of the fairy GodTeacherüë¥. 
            maybe, in this chapter we‚Äôll see some character development, maybe the dreaded fee monster won't be able to incapacitate him like before.
            maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel,
            maybe this is the key to his object,
            maybe god has put an addEventListener to his pleas,
            maybe his function has finally been called,
            maybe his pull request has finally been merged,

            On a different page.
            A new realisation has again hit our main character
            "I don't know if I am the main character, I don't know if I am important to the plot but one thing I do know is I am a character,<br> therefore,I exist,
            I have a role, I play a part and i will try to play it well "

                "I hold the world but as the world,Gratiano-A stage 
                where every man must play a part" <br>

            I have seen my value brought down to the fees I did not pay or my rollno or the percentage I got or the assignment I did not submit.

            A very big thank you to Tanay sir,Tanvi,Swapnil and Team Tanay for
            making this happen.
            I cannot thank you enough for giving the Main Character a hope.
