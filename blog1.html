        <h1>Objects And Arrays</h1>
        <small>
            <strong>
                5th September,2021
            </strong> 
        </small>
        <p> 
            maybe as I learn more about programming I will find more fascinating things 
            in the HTML, CSS and Javascript world 
            but presently in data structures I find objects and arrays very Interesting,

            I'll tell you why?
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Objects</h3>
                <p>
                    Objects stores data in the form of a key:value pair,
                you give the key you get the value and it is enclosed within 
                these "{}"" braces.
                A typical objects look like-
                Example: <img src="/images/s1.jpg">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of object like that early morning cartoon character Oswald--
                    He's again out to run some errand---holding winnie's leash--henry gave 
                    him some ice---daisy gave him a flower--baby katarina some chocolate, 
                    his tentacles here are the keys/properties. 
                    this model is called "tentacle model" üêô
                    with objects you can objectify things in a good way.

                </p>
                <strong>How to access an object's property/key values? </strong>
                 <p>
                <ol>
                    With the help of
                    <li>
                        (.) dot notation
                        <img src="/images/s2.jpg">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       ( [] ) square brackets
                        <img class="s3"src="/images/s3.jpg">
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                We usually make us of dot notation and 
                we use square brackets when the property
                isn't that clear.
                and you can also modify an objects property
                values, externally--
                <img class="s4"src="/images/s4.jpg">
                
                </p>
                
                </p>
                <h3>Arrays</h3>
                <p>
                    Array is a list of things-it has all the things stored in a list like order
                    Example:
                    <img class="s5"src="/images/s5.jpg">
                    <br>
                    The data type a little similar to arrays is strings but we cannot do calculation and we certainly cannot put individual
                    things apart,yet together.
                    Example: <br>
                         strings "a" + "bc" = abc <br>
                         and if "1" + "2" =12 <br>
                         so to do numeric operations we take Arrays <br>
                                       
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How to access an Arrays' values? </strong>
                    <br>
                    <img src="/images/s6.jpg" ><br>
                    the syntax to access values is :<br>
                     groceryList[i] , where i=number of the Array element.<br>
                    Now if i ask you to get me milk from groceryList, 
                    your instinct would be -> groceryList[1]--->üòë <br> 
                    but No in Arrays we count elements from 0 
                    that is---to get milk---you have to type -> groceryList[0]
                                       

                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="/images/s7.jpg" ><br>
                    Here, we created an object superHeroes 
                    and added superMan and BatMan inside it. superMan and batMan are keys/properties and also individual object.
                    you can also convert all the keys' in an object to Array. <br>
                    Object.keys(object name)
                    <img src="/images/s8.jpg">

                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also combine an Array and Object. <br>
                    example: <br>
                        <img src="images/s9.jpg">
                        Here we have created a database dB which is an object,
                        inside we have--
                        defined objects(genre) : javascript ,business ,fiction. 
                        the object (genre)here are keys to constDB  
                        and objects(genre) have values in an Array  
                        inside the array we have two more objects(book-names),
                        we have combined our knowledge of Array and objects and 
                        successfully created a book databaseüéâ
                </p>
                <p>One more analogy i found in the <em>book</em>
                    was that objects and arrays give us the ability to put 
                    different things in a single value like putting all related
                    things in a bag and running around with it,
                    instead of trying to hold everything.
                    You must be thinkingüßê Which book ?

                <p>
                    If you are beginner>beginner,
                    you will definitely find it confusing, as this book 
                    is not going to spoonfeed you everything.
                    This book has no mercy for beginners'.
