        <h1>Objects And Arrays</h1>
        <small>
            <strong>
                5th September,2021
            </strong> 
        </small>
        <p> 
            maybe as I learn more about programming I will find more fascinating things 
            in the HTML, CSS and Javascript world 
            but presently in data structures I find objects and arrays very Interesting,

            I'll tell you why?
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Objects</h3>
                <p>
                    Objects stores data in the form of a key:value pair,
                you give the key you get the value and it is enclosed within 
                these "{}"" braces.
                A typical objects look like-
                Example: <img src="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of object like that early morning cartoon character Oswald--
                    He's again out to run some errand---holding winnie's leash--henry gave 
                    him some ice---daisy gave him a flower--baby katarina some chocolate, 
                    his tentacles here are the keys/properties. 
                    this model is called "tentacle model" üêô
                    with objects you can objectify things in a good way.

                </p>
                <strong>How to access an object's property/key values? </strong>
                 <p>
                <ol>
                    With the help of
                    <li>
                        (.) dot notation
                        <img src="">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       ( [] ) square brackets
                        <img src="">
                    </li>
                    
                </ol>
                We usually make us of dot notation and 
                we use square brackets when the property
                isn't that clear.
                and you can also modify an objects property
                values externally
                superman.strength="400";
                also 
                </p>
                <h3>Arrays</h3>
                <p>
                    Array is a list of things-it has all the things stored in a list like order
                    Example:
                    <img src="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data type a little similar to arrays is strings but we cannot do calculation and we certainly cannot put individual
                    things apart,yet together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How to access an Arrays' values? </strong>
                    <img src="" >
                    the syntax to access values is 
                    console.log(groceryList[i])
                    i is for the number
                    Now if i ask you to get me milk from that list 
                    your instinct would be groceryList[1]
                    but No in Arrays we count elements from 0
                    So the correct answer is 
                                        groceryList[0]

                </p>
                <p>
                    you can also convert all the keys' in an object to Array.
                    Object.keys(superheroes)

                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also create a Hybrid of an Array and Object.
                    example:
                        <img src="">
                        const bookDB
                </p>
                <p>One more analogy i found in the book
                    was that objects and arrays give us the ability of putting 
                    different things in a single value like putting all related
                    things in a bag and running around with it.
                    instead of trying to hold everything.
                    You must be thinkingüßê Which book?

                    If you are beginner>beginner,
                    you will definitely find it confusing, as this book 
                    is not going to spoonfeed you everything.
                    This book has no mercy for beginner bees'.
